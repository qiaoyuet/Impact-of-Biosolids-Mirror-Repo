## Client Information

Emma Avery is a MSc student in Soil Sciences at UBC, where she is researching the long term impacts of a biosolids application on rangeland soil quality and plant species composition. She completed her undergraduate degree in the Faculty of Land and Food Systems, studying plant and soil sciences in the Global Resource Systems program. Since then, she has grown a love of farming and local food systems through working on several small scale, organic vegetable and livestock farms, including the UBC farm. Emma is looking forward to deepening her understanding and appreciation for soil throughout her studies at UBC and in the field. When she’s not in the lab or at the UBC farm, she might be found riding her bike or getting into nature.
