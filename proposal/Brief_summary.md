## Introduction

A randomized complete block design was conducted to examine the long term impacts of biosolids application on grassland plant communities and soil health in 2002 at the OK Ranch, Jesmond, BC. This experimental design had two treatment replicated in each of four blocks: (i) single application of biosolids at 20 dry Mg ha-1 and (ii) no biosolids (control). 

One objective of this study is to investigate whether the single biosolids application contribution to overall improved soil structure by providing a food source for microbial activity and forming soil aggregates. This improvements to soil structure can increase the water and nutrient holding capacity of the soil. To examine the presence of the weighted average size of stable aggregate in the soil, mean weighted diameter (MWD) of aggregates was considered as a parameter. The larger MWD value means the larger stable aggregates of soil structure. So we have to analyze whether the treatment and sampling date has an impact on the aggregate MWD and individuals aggregate size fractions (6-2mm, 1- 2mm, and 1-0.25mm)

Another objective of this study is to examine the correlations between plant species composition and aggregate stability. Plant species composition is the visual assessment of percent covered by species, as well as percent cover of exposed soil and microbiotic crust. So it would be enough if we can prove any statistical correlation between plant cover (or lack thereof) and aggregate stability.


## Data collection and sampling process

The experiment was started at 2002 and since then plant species composition data was been collected for 5 consecutive years (2002-2006) and was sampled again in 2016. Plant species composition data was collected only once per year, in the summer (June/July). But the soil data was only been collected 4 times over the growing season (April, June, August and October) in one year (2016).

To take sample appropriately each block was divided in half to form the experimental units, and one treatment was applied to each half. Five 50-m-long transects were systematically arranged to provide balanced coverage within each experimental unit. Ten sample plant were sampled (0.2 by 0.5 m) from each of the transects to investigate the visual estimates of plant cover in total of 50 plots in one trransects. So the total number of vegetation assessments taken annually was 400 (4 blocks × 2 treatments × 5 transects × 10 samples per transect).

For the soil sampling, three 50-m-long transects place between the plant transects in each experimental unit. A subsample was composited from each transect by combining 7 soil samples from every 7m along the transect. The total number of soil samples collected in 2016 was 96 (4 sampling dates x 4 blocks x 2 treatments x 3 transects x 1 composite sample per transect). Furthermore, the lab analysis was run on 3 different size fractions of the soil samples (soil aggregates of 6-2mm, 1- 2mm, and 1-0.25mm).
