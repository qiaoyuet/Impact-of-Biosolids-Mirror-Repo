#### Summary

This report examines the effectiveness of biosolids, a new kind of fertilizer that potentially enhances soil activity by providing food sources through microbial activities. In particular, we compare the magnitude of Mean Weight Diameter (MWD), a parameter measuring soil stability, with and without biosolids application. We also compare the magnitude of cover value, a criterion for spread of plant species, between observations under biosolids and control. The impact of biosolids on soil stability is analyzed by a mixed effect model. The effect on spread of plant species is addressed by linear regression. The correlation between MWD and cover value is also examined. We find strong evidence that biosolids significantly increases soil productivity and coverage of certain plant species. We also find that MWD and cover value are positively correlated.

#### 1. Introduction

Soil productivity is an important issue affecting agricultural activities and biodiversity. Our client, Emma Avery, is completing her thesis for Master of Soil Science degree which investigates the long term impact of biosolids on soil health and grassland plant communities. Biosolids, the main interest of the experiment, is a fertilizer that provides food sources for microbial activities to enhance soil productivity. The experiment was conducted in 2002 at OK Ranch, Jasmond, BC. Four grasslands were randomly chosen and either applied biosolids or left as control (no biosolids). Later, the data were collected in 2016 and passed on to us in January 2017 for analysis. This report’s primary interest is to investigate whether Mean Weight Diameter (MWD), a parameter that quantifies soil productivity, is affected by 1) treatment type and 2) sampling date. The secondary interest is to explore the effect of biosolids on specific plant species composition. The third interest is to examine the correlation between MWD and the cover value of plants. The report assesses the significance of biosolids application on soil productivity and plant composition. It indicates that Biosolids performs well in terms of enhancing soil stability and increasing spread of plant species. Starting with a description of dataset and methods, the report addresses the above questions of interests with detailed analysis and ends with conclusions and further discussions. 

#### 2. Data Description

The experiment was laid out in 4 pieces of land with similar characteristics which are treated as blocks. The investigator randomly applied biosolids to half of each block and no biosolids to the other half. Within each half of a block, 3 equally spaced transects were arranged. MWD(mm) data were obtained from 7 fixed sample spots along each transect. This process was conducted four times: April, June, August and October 2016 respectively. The dataset given to us includes the sampling month, block index, treatment type, transect number and the MWD averaged from those 7 soil samples for each transect. So the total number of soil samples are 96 (4 sampling dates x 4 blocks x 2 treatments x 3 transects x 1 composite sample per transect).

Figure 2.1 shows the boxplots of MWD under both biosolids and control in 4 sampling dates. In April, August and October, we observe that data points under biosolids have higher MWD than those under control. This can be seen from the upward shift of data points under biosolids in the boxplots. In June, the data points under biosolids overlap with those under control, but the median under biosolids is higher. Table 2.1 shows the mean and standard deviation of MWD for 8 treatment-block combinations.

```{r,echo=FALSE}
soil<-read.table("MWD.csv", sep = ",", header = T) 
ggplot(aes(y=MWD, x=Treatment, fill = Treatment, alpha = 0.4), data=soil) + geom_boxplot() + geom_point() + facet_wrap(~Date) + labs(y="MWD (mm)", title="Boxplots of MWD over Sampling Dates")
```

```{r,echo=FALSE}
group_by(soil,Date,Treatment) %>%
  summarise(mean(MWD), sd(MWD))
```

For the investigation of plants, 5 plant transects were laid out in half of a block. The researchers randomly selected 10 plots from each transect. Visual assessment was done for each plot. The species present and the corresponding abundance were recorded. The measurement of plant composition was quantified by cover class, a number from 1 to 6 that assesses the canopy cover of plant species. Cover class was then converted to cover value which is a number in percentage and is in one-to-one correspondence to cover class. For example, cover class 1 represents a cover from 0% to 5%. The midpoint 2.5% is the cover value corresponding to cover class 1. Therefore there are 6 cover values in the dataset: 2.5%, 15%, 37.5%, 62.5%, 85%, 97.5%. The dataset includes the plant species name, block index, treatment type, plot number, cover class and cover value. The total number of plant assessments is 400 (4 blocks × 2 treatments × 5 transects × 10 samples per transect). If researchers did not observe a species for certain plots, the entry of that species is omitted instead of being recorded as 0. In the following analysis, we specifically investigate one species, POPR.

Table 2.2 describes the frequencies of cover values appearing under biosolids application and control for all species. The bar graphs (Figure 2.2) provide a better visualization for the results in Table 2.2. We observe that when changing from control group to biosolids group, there is a dramatic decrease in number of observations with low cover values (<=37.5), and an increase in number of observations with high cover values (>37.5). For the specific species POPR, Table 2.3 summarizes the frequencies of observations under 6 levels of cover values for biosolids and control respectively. The counts under two treatments are quite different, indicating that biosolids is potentially effective.

Figure 2.3 and 2.4 provide visualizations of change and variation in cover values under both biosolids and control for POPR. Each point represents the mean cover value under a specific treatment-block combination. The observed cover value under control group are close to 0 in all four blocks while the cover values under biosolids are quite high. We also observe that the change in cover value for biosolids group is different in four blocks. But we do not consider any interaction effects involving block, because they are not of interest.

```{r,echo=FALSE}
pc.subset <- pc.subset[ ,c(3,4,9)]
by_blockTrt <- group_by(pc.subset, Block, Treatment)
dat.avg<-summarise(by_blockTrt, y.avg=sum(Cover.value)/50)

```

#### 3. Methods

##### Long term impact of biosolids on soil (MWD)

We use a mixed-effect linear model which has both fixed and random effects. In our context, MWD is the response variable. Treatment is a fixed effect, because the experimenters directly manipulate the application of treatment to the soil. Date is also a fixed effect, because the four sampling dates are predetermined by the researchers. Block is treated as a random effect, because we use random effect to handle the issue of dependencies that arise from the experimental design. 

There are two complications in the design:

“Repeated measurements” is the case where observations are taken from the same subject several times. In our case, MWD is measured in roughly the same place four times during the growing season. These four observations are dependent, because they are affected by common characteristics belonging to the same sampling location. 

Another complication is the transects setup. It results in the problem of “Pseudoreplication” where replicated observations are not independent. There are two sources of pseudo replication in our case: 

- The seven soil samples along one transect are pseudo replicates. Because the soil composition measurement in one place will be highly correlated with that five feet away.   
- In every half of the block, the three transects are pseudo replicates. Because they belong to the same experimental unit. The conditions affecting one transect will also affect another transect in that half of the block. 

Therefore, both repeated measurements and pseudoreplication violate the assumption of independence that is assumed in linear models. The way we tackle this problem is to introduce a random block effect into the model. This mixed-effect linear model will then analyze the data in a way that is similar to randomized complete block design but with a random block effect. Although transect is not included in the model, it is not of particular interest to the researchers. Moreover, it is inappropriate to investigate the variation across transects since they are not entirely independent. 

##### Long term impact of biosolids on plant cover

The same problem of pseudoreplication also appears in the plant cover dataset. The observations within and between 5 plant transects are dependent for the same reasons described in soil transects. The method we use is to take the average of cover value over each treatment-block combination. Then for treatment group, we have four independent observations from the four blocks. For control group, we also have four independent observations from the four blocks. For a block-treatment combination in which experimenters did not observe any presence of POPR, we add a cover value of 0 for that specific combination. Then we can fit a usual linear model to this averaged dataset with the averaged cover value as the response variable and treatment as the explanatory variable.

In addition, averaging observations from each block-treatment combination solves the problem that the response variable is discrete. Since we take an average over 50 discrete observations for each combination, the averaged cover value resembles the underlying continuous values. Therefore the usual linear model introduced above applies. 

#### 4. Results

##### Long term impact of biosolids on soil

The normality assumption is validated by the histogram of MWD (Figure 4.1) and normal quantile-quantile plot (Figure 4.2). The histogram shows that the sample distribution of MWD is approximately normal, indicating a normal underlying distribution of MWD. The normal qq plot shows the sample quantiles from MWD dataset against the theoretical quantiles from the standard normal distribution. The fact that most of the points align well with the straight line suggests normality.

Figure 4.2 Normal quantile-quantile plot of MWD.

We used Chi-square test to investigate the significance of treatment effect, date effect and treatment-date interaction effect respectively:

- A p-value of 0.006 shows strong evidence that treatment main effect is significant at 1% significance level.
- A p-value less than 0.001 shows very strong evidence that date main effect is significant even at 0.1% significance level. 
- A p-value of 0.008 shows strong evidence that treatment-date interaction effect is significant at 1% significance level.

Two treatment types and four sampling dates give us eight combinations. The intercept estimate 0.88 is the mean MWD of control group in April (baseline group). From April to June, the mean MWD of control group increase by 0.838mm [0.719mm, 0.956mm] with 95% confidence. This is the most dramatic increase in MWD among the four sampling dates as Figure 4.3 shows. Moreover, all the estimates for the main effects of dates are positive. It means that MWD always increases as sampling dates change compared to April. As for the main effect of biosolids on soil, mean MWD in biosolids group increases 0.172mm [0.054mm, 0.261mm] compared to the control group in April with 95% confidence.

The treatment-date interaction effect accounts for the extra change in MWD that is not explained by adding up the main effect of treatment and date when compared with the baseline group. For example, the mean MWD for biosolids group in October is 1.668mm, which is 0.788mm larger than that for baseline group. There is an increase of 0.376mm in mean MWD from April to October. There is another increase of 0.172mm in mean MWD from control group to biosolids group. But they do not add up to 0.788mm. The rest of the difference between the two groups is explained by the interaction effect between biosolids and October (0.240mm with 95% confidence interval [0.085mm, 0.409mm]). Visually from the interaction plot (Figure 4.3), we can see that the change in mean MWD over the four sampling dates is quite different for the two treatment groups. Especially from June to August, the mean MWD increase for biosolids group, while the mean MWD decreases for control group. This corroborates the significance of the interaction effect between treatment and date.  

```{r,echo=FALSE}
Date.f = factor(soil$Date,levels(soil$Date)[c(1, 3, 2, 4)])
ggplot(soil, aes(x = Date.f, y = MWD, group = Treatment, colour = Treatment)) +
  stat_summary(fun.y="mean", geom = "line") +
  labs(x = "Date", y="MWD (mm)", title = "Change in MWD over 4 Sampling Dates")
```

Figure 4.3 Change in mean of MWD over the four sampling dates.

##### Long term impact of biosolids on plant cover

We check the following assumptions for linear model:  

- Normality assumption is checked by histogram of cover value (Figure 4.4). The distribution of cover values of POPR does not look normal. This is potentially due to the fact that cover value is not normally distributed in nature. In addition, the sample size of the averaged dataset is too small to appear normal. Since averaging and using linear regression is our second best solution to deal with discrete cover value, we assume that this violation of normality would not create significant bias on results.  
- Common variance assumption is achieved by a weaker condition that we have equal number of observations (n=4) under biosolids and control.  
- Independence is automatically achieved by averaging dependent observations. Since we only have one observation from each experimental unit (half of a block), the observations satisfy the independence assumption.

```{r,echo=FALSE}
hist(pc.subset$Cover.value, main="Histogram of cover value for POPR", xlab = "POPR Cover Value (%)", col = "mistyrose")
```

Figure 4.4 Histogram of cover value for species POPR.


After fitting a regression model with averaged cover value per block as response variable and treatment factor as explanatory variable, we obtain a p-value of 0.00984 for biosolids treatment. With a p-value smaller than 0.01, we find strong evidence to reject the null hypothesis that biosolids and control produce indifferent cover values. When changing from control to biosolids, we expect an estimated increase of 25.738% [8.815%, 42.661%] in cover value of POPR with 95% confidence.

##### Correlation between MWD and cover value

Since there are an unequal number of observations of MWD and cover value, we test correlation using the eight means from the eight treatment-block combinations for both MWD and cover value. The estimated correlation is 0.645 which indicates a moderately strong positive relationship between MWD and cover value. It means that when soil becomes more stable (larger MWD), the canopy cover of POPR increases, which is intuitive.

#### 5. Conclusions & Furthur Discussion

There is strong evidence that biosolids application and sampling dates have significant impact on improving soil stability. They affect MWD interactively instead of individually. There is also strong evidence that biosolids application increases the spread of species POPR. There is a moderate positive correlation between MWD and cover value. In conclusion, biosolids is an effective fertilizer that enhances soil stability and plant canopy cover. Better soil quality is associated with more growth of the plants.     

For further studies, ordinal regression is more appropriate for plant investigation because cover value is a discrete variable. In terms of the experimental design, we recommend that researchers increase the number of blocks instead of transects in order to increase the number of independent observations. Moreover, soil/plant samples could be taken randomly in blocks instead of in fixed transects since proper randomization can balance potentially important explanatory variables at the design stage.
